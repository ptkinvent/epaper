# e-Paper Display #
This is a catch-all project to collect scripts for my e-Paper project. The hardware setup is a very low-power solution for displaying slowly-updating monochrome text and images. It consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to a 7.5-inch e-ink display.

The folders in the `lib/` folder are taken from https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper.
